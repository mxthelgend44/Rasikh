//! Recovery routes: the advisory, bounded search over the remedies a block stands in (`RMD-20`).
//!
//! A remedy plan is one stage (`RMD-4`, `RMD-19`): the sound next alternatives from the live
//! candidate, each an executable offer. A **recovery route** looks further, over an abstract state
//! rather than the log: it composes the same steps — acceptance, rulings, an output sanitizer, an
//! input hop, and the tools an `RMD-13` plan names — and re-checks every later step in the state
//! the earlier steps produce. It appends no fact, mints no offer, and changes nothing in
//! `remedy_plans`, their order, or the emptiness assertion of `RMD-10`; every step it names still
//! passes its ordinary check when the agent attempts it.
//!
//! **What a route may plan over.** Call-bound decisions — a ruling, an acceptance of the blocked
//! call's narrowing, an input hop, a denial — bind the exact rendered call (`RUL-3`, `RMD-16`),
//! so they are planned for the blocked call only. A tool run first ([`RouteStep::Precede`]) has
//! no call yet: it contributes only what its registered contract fixes before any call exists —
//! [`StaticAnnotation`]: no annotator answers, no placeholder recipients, a declared and established
//! delta — evaluated in the success branch, where its `emits` are committed effects and its
//! declared narrowing has folded. Anything less determined ends the route as a
//! [`RouteOutcome::Prefix`] naming what must land before planning resumes ([`Resume`]).
//!
//! **Bound and totality.** [`RouteDepth`] is the number of calls a route spans, the blocked call
//! included. At `RouteDepth::ONE` the routes are exactly the RMD plans. A tool enters a route
//! only for a `prior` or cap gap of the call it immediately serves — the blocked call, or a
//! preceding tool that needs it first — as `RMD-13` names tool plans; a tool that clears nothing
//! for the call in front of it is never dispatched. A set of preceding tools is planned once, in
//! the first order the search meets (tool-name order): every order of the same tools folds the
//! same deltas and commits the same effects, so it reaches the same state and continues alike.
//! Within that shape enumeration is total: nothing is truncated, and an empty result asserts
//! only that no route exists within this abstraction and this depth, never that the block is
//! unliftable. Termination: the depth bounds the preceding tools, and no tool recurs on one
//! path. Cost grows with the sets of at most `depth − 1` registered tools, not their orderings;
//! the depth is the operator's bound (`CFG-26`), and the engine clamps nothing.
//!
//! **Order** (`RMD-20`). Least mandate power first, as `RMD-15` compares plans, then least
//! disclosure — the readers outside the committed audience that the route's rulings admit a flow
//! to — then fewer steps, then canonical bytes. The first two form a strict partial order; the
//! last two make the extraction total, so the list is deterministic.
