//! Remedy planning: turning a raw block into the sound remedies the agent may act on.
//!
//! A [`PlannedBlock`] carries the block as found plus **executable plans** (atomic
//! `Authorize`/`Accept` compositions run through `execute_remedy_plan`) and **id-less redispatch
//! recommendations** (`Redispatch` — call another tool first, then re-propose; `Fork` — advisory
//! only). The security claim lives here: an **empty** set of executable plans *and* direct
//! redispatches is a *proof* that the block is unliftable — relative to the implemented remedy
//! subset, read at the current stage against registered configuration and recorded denials
//! An empty list is a proof, not a shrug.
//!
//! **A redispatch clears its gap directly or is not offered**. A plan for a failed
//! `prior(k)` names a registered tool whose `emits` includes `k`. A plan for a failed cap names a
//! tool whose own established restrictive audience contribution, folded into the current label,
//! lands within the cap. Only a declared audience delta can prove that: an Annotated tool's
//! contribution exists only per call, so it claims nothing at load. The blocked target's own
//! delta takes no part in the claim — audience only
//! narrows under `combine`, so a candidate that clears on its own contribution still clears when
//! the target's delta folds after it, while one that needs the target's help is target-assisted
//! advice this module does not offer. The named tool is dispatched as an ordinary separately-checked
//! call: its own requirements, denials, and reservations bite at its own block, when it is
//! actually proposed — a directly clearing tool is sound advice even when its own call would
//! block today.
//!
//! **Alternatives.** A clearable block offers **every sound alternative**: each unique grouped
//! authority assignment (per-gap choice among competent authorities) crossed with each way of
//! settling the narrowing — acceptance, withholding the result, or an applicable output sanitizer
//! with the residual it cannot shed. Enumeration is made total by the registry's load-time bound ([`crate::registry`]'s
//! `PlannerCap`), which spans both factors — no runtime truncation. A separate
//! assignment-set property checks the enumeration set-equal against an independent reference
//! enumerator, and the redispatch list is checked against an independent direct-set reference.
//!
//! **Implemented remedy subset (the honest bound).** `Authorize` (trust floor via `trust_ceiling`,
//! `includes` via `reader_ceiling`, `no_prior` via `waivers`, attention via `attends`), `Accept`
//! (narrowing), `Withhold` (execution without admitting result output), `Sanitize` (an
//! output sanitizer's relabel standing in for the raw crossing),
//! `Derive` (an input sanitizer's substitution of the whole argument set), and `Redispatch` over direct `prior(k)` emitters and static cap-narrowing tools, in
//! name order — the agent picks, and each redispatch is separately checked for real.
//! The empty-proof is complete over exactly this subset.
//!
//! **A sanitize step settles a narrowing and never a requirement gap**. The gaps are
//! evaluated on the raw committed label even in a plan that sanitizes: a requirement gates the
//! dispatch, and the dispatch happens before any derivation exists, so a promise to clean the
//! result afterwards cannot justify the release. That is the fail-closed direction, and it is why
//! adding the step leaves `is_curable` unchanged — acceptance was already always available for a
//! narrowing, so the sanitizer adds alternatives, never remedies for a requirement gap.
//!
//! **A marked spawn declares its child's return policy here.** The spawn is blocked until an
//! approval carries one, and every plan for it ends in a `Return` step: the floor the parent
//! supplies at execution, and the sanitizer — none, the schema attestation, or one registered
//! untagged output sanitizer — the plan names. A child return itself is never planned: it
//! crosses at the child's stop, or is refused there, against the policy the fork recorded.
//!
//! **A fork's floor binds the child's remedies.** Inside a forked trajectory no plan accepts a
//! narrowing below the floor its parent set, on the dimensions the fork's sanitizer does not
//! raise: [`narrowing_remedies`] and [`confined_stage`] omit the acceptance, and the remaining
//! plans stand. A grandchild's floor is declared against the child's own, so the bound is
//! inherited down the family.

///   result's restriction on both dimensions. `Withhold` admits no Value, so the result leaves

/// - A sanitizer's `permits` is a declassification grant that the engine trusts the external
///   implementation to earn. The engine enforces `Withhold` itself by never admitting the
///   result bytes, so no external implementation has to be trusted.
/// - `Withhold` is offered only for a confined tool that declares effects. Without effects,
///   running a tool and discarding its result achieves nothing. Sanitizer applicability reads
