//! The canonical hook wire: the one JSON shape `POST /hook` accepts and
//! the one it answers with, versioned by [`PROTOCOL`].
//!
//! A host's adapter translates its own event shape into a [`WireEvent`]
//! on the client side (Claude Code through `appa hook`, kagent inside its
//! ADK plugin) and reads a [`WireDecision`] back. The wire carries the
//! host's raw tool spelling and nothing the runtime would have to trust:
//! whether a call is a spawn, which canonical tool it names, and whether
//! it is the runtime's own control tool are all identified on the server
//! from the configured adapter and the raw spelling
//! ([`Adapter::identify_tool`]). A result's lifecycle follows that same
//! identification and not the event name it arrived under, so `tool_result`
//! and `spawn_result` differ only in the fields they may carry;
//! whether a proposed call's arguments name a
//! child's transcript is the same adapter's separate answer
//! ([`Adapter::names_children`]), asked at the call, where it is used.
//! A host's opaque `call_id` binds a call and its result to one internal
//! dispatch without becoming that dispatch's identity. This permits
//! ordinary calls to overlap and report in any order.
//! Ids cross unprefixed and the server applies the configured adapter's
//! prefix, so no caller can speak for another adapter's trajectories.
//! A person's
//! [`Ruling`] crosses only under a host that reviews through its own
//! channel ([`AdapterName::review_channel`]), and there only on the
//! control call that quotes the offer it answers. Under any other host,
//! on any other call, or on any other event — no other event reads one —
//! the envelope asserting one is refused.
//!
//! A decision that stands in for a result says on the wire which of the
//! two it carries, because a client may rewrite one and may not rewrite
//! the other. `deliver_value` and `child_return` carry a `value` the
//! engine admitted: the client delivers those bytes as they crossed. A
//! decision carrying the runtime's own words — `replace_output`,
//! `deny_call`, `block`, `refuse` — carries text authored here, which
//! names tools by the spelling that host sent, so a client whose model
//! dispatches other names spells them back before the model reads it.
//! No client tells the two apart by reading the payload.
//!
//! The event and decision structs are flat with optional fields rather
//! than tagged enums because `arguments` is a `RawValue`, which serde's
//! internally tagged representation cannot carry.
